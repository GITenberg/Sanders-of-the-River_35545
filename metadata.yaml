description: Charged with the task of engaging with the indigenous peoples of Nigeria
  during the colonial period, Sanders takes a no-nonsense approach that, though it
  may offend the sensibilities of current-day readers, is unquestionably effective.
  Offering readers an action-packed glimpse into a period of history that is often
  overlooked. Sanders of the River should be on the must-read list of every action-adventure
  junkie.
